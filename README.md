**About this repository**

This repository contains my assessment submission for the module Computer Infrastructure following the lectures of [Ian McLoughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/2425_computer_infrastructure). 

The repository consists of two parts: the tasks and the project. With the tasks and the project from the module, I have been able to learn and develop skills in:

* Use, configure, and execute scripts in a command-line interface environment.
* Manipulate and move data and code using the command line.
* Compare commonly available software infrastructures and architectures.
* Select appropriate infrastructure for a given computational task.
* Create a script to run daily and push new data to my repository.

The descriptions of the tasks and how I completed them can be found in the Jupyter Notebook [wetaher.ipynb](https://github.com/Jennyicano/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.ipynb)

For the project, I automated my [weather.sh](https://github.com/Jennyicano/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.sh) script to run daily and push the new data to my repository and save it in the [data/weather](https://github.com/Jennyicano/computer_infrastructure/tree/main/data/weather) directory.  The steps that I followed to automate my script can be found in the following file of GitHub Actions workflow: 
* [weather-data.yml](https://github.com/Jennyicano/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/.github/workflows/weather-data.yml)

**Getting started**

The tools that I needed to install and then I used in my computer to complete the module tasks and project were the following: 

* [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success). 
* Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* Sign up in [GitHub Student](https://education.github.com/pack)
